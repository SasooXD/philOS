Barebones 16-bit operating system with UNIX-like functionalities, built and _(soon to be)_ tested on a real and working Intel 8086. The circuit diagram, as well as a list of used components are also present.

**This is still work in progress. No updates are provided besides commit logs and occasional binary releases.**
